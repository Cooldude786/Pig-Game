The Pig Game is a simple and fun dice game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The objective of the game is to be the first player to reach the specified winning score.

## How to Play

1. The game is played with a single six-sided dice.
2. Each turn, a player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The total score for that turn is the sum of the rolled dice values.
3. If a player rolls a 1, all the points accumulated during that turn are lost, and it becomes the other player's turn.
4. The player can choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn to add the current turn's score to their total score.
5. The first player to reach the specified winning score wins the game.
